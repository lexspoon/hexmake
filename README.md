Hexmake
=======

Hexmake is a minimal artifact-based build tool. It's designed in the
spirit of Bazel, Pants, or Buck, but with a clean separation between
the build tool itself and the configuration scripts that customize the
tool for a particular project. It's comparable in scope to Make,
rather than being Make+Autoconf+many other things in one giant tool.

The name Hexmake is chosen because it is a variant of the "Make"
tool, and because every other name based on "make" is taken
by some other project. Cmake, for caching make? Taken. Bcache,
for build cache? Taken. Bake? Forge? Cake? All taken.
This tool is therefore called Hexmake.

Hexmake. Add a little sparkle and magic to your build, with Hexmake.
